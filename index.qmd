This is my course website for MATH-472, Computational Statistics. I took this course during Spring 2023; it was cotaught with MATH-572 (its MS equivalent), instructed by Dr. Kyungduk Ko at Boise State University.

As much as possible, I tried to keep good notes in LaTeX format during the lectures, although they're somewhat incomplete. Some of what was discussed I noted by hand. These notes can be found [here.](class-notes.qmd)

I also host my homework submissions on this site. They can be found [here.](homework.qmd) I plan on uploading feedback and corrections, if I have time.
